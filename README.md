# Chess Project

This is a chess game with an integrated AI.

### How to work

The main tool of our project will be the **GitHub Issues**. Everything that needs to be reported will be there (what needs to be done, what is being done, bugs encountered, help needed...).

**How to use Issues:**

I (DatUser) will be in charge of releasing these issues.
Whenever someone is assigned to an issue or assigns himself to it, he becomes responsible of it. He will be in charge of updating the state of this issue using the labels. More information can be provided to issues by commenting them.

***Label Code***

* *bug:* Something isn't working
* *done:* Task is finished
* *help needed:* Help is needed (assign people you need help from to the task)
* *in progress:* Task in progress
* *to do:* Task that needs to be done

***To make this work and have sense, eveyone needs to check the issues regularly!***
